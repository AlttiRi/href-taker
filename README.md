### Filters

To filter the result list use "Only" and "Ignore" inputs.

The result list will have any URL which includes any word from **Only** input and no one from **Ignore** input.

Use the right mouse button (RMB) click on the input prompt ("Only"/"Ignore" text) to disable the input rule.

Additionally, with the middle mouse button (MMB) click on the "Only" text you can reverse the filter rule.
